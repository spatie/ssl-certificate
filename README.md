The class provided by this package makes it incredibly easy to query the properties on an ssl certificate. We have three options for fetching a certficate. Here's an example:
```php
use Spatie\SslCertificate\SslCertificate;

// fetch the certificate using an url
$certificate = SslCertificate::createForHostName('spatie.be');

// or from a certificate file
$certificate = SslCertificate::createFromFile($pathToCertificateFile);

// or from a string
$certificate = SslCertificate::createFromString($certificateData);

$certificate->getIssuer(); // returns "Let's Encrypt Authority X3"
$certificate->isValid(); // returns true if the certificate is currently valid
$certificate->validFromDate(); // returns a Carbon instance Carbon
$certificate->expirationDate(); // returns a Carbon instance Carbon
$certificate->lifespanInDays(); // return the amount of days between  validFromDate and expirationDate
$certificate->expirationDate()->diffInDays(); // returns an int
$certificate->getSignatureAlgorithm(); // returns a string
$certificate->getOrganization(); // returns the organization name when available
```

#### Downloading invalid certificate

If you want to download certificates even if they are invalid (for example, if they are expired), you can pass a `$verifyCertificate` boolean to `SslCertificate::createFromHostname()` as the third argument, for example:

```
$certificate = SslCertificate::createForHostName('expired.badssl.com', $timeoutInSeconds, false);
```

We invest a lot of resources into creating [best in class open source packages](https://spatie.be/open-source). You can support us by [buying one of our paid products](https://spatie.be/open-source/support-us).

We highly appreciate you sending us a postcard from your hometown, mentioning which of our package(s) you are using. You'll find our address on [our contact page](https://spatie.be/about-us). We publish all received postcards on [our virtual postcard wall](https://spatie.be/open-source/postcards).

## Installation

You can install the package via composer:

```bash
composer require spatie/ssl-certificate
```

## Important notice

Currently, this package [does not check](https://github.com/spatie/ssl-certificate/blob/master/src/SslCertificate.php#L63-L74) if the certificate is signed by a trusted authority. We'll add this check soon in a next point release.

## Usage

You can create an instance of `Spatie\SslCertificate\SslCertificate` with this named constructor:

```php
$certificate = SslCertificate::createForHostName('spatie.be');
```

You can create an instance of `Spatie\SslCertificate\SslCertificate` passing the port with this named constructor:

```php
$certificate = SslCertificate::createForHostName('spatie.be:443');
```

You can use this fluent style to specify a specific port to connect to.

```php
SslCertificate::download()
   ->usingPort($customPort)
   ->forHost($hostName);
```

You can check the certificate on a different IP address using the same style.
```php
SslCertificate::download()
   ->fromIpAddress($ipAddress)
   ->forHost($hostName);
```

This also works with IPv6 addresses
```php
SslCertificate::download()
    ->fromIpAddress('2a00:1450:4001:80e::200e')
    ->forHost('google.com');
```

You can specify [socket context options](https://www.php.net/manual/en/context.socket.php).
```php
SslCertificate::download()
   ->withSocketContextOptions([
      'option' => 'value',
   ])
   ->forHost($hostName);
```

If the given `ipAddress` is invalid `Spatie\SslCertificate\Exceptions\InvalidIpAddress` will be thrown.

If the given `hostName` is invalid `Spatie\SslCertificate\Exceptions\InvalidUrl` will be thrown.

If the given `hostName` is valid but there was a problem downloading the certifcate `Spatie\SslCertificate\Exceptions\CouldNotDownloadCertificate` will be thrown.

### Getting the issuer name

```php
$certificate->getIssuer(); // returns "Let's Encrypt Authority X3"
```

### Getting the domain name

Returns the primary domain name for the certificate

```php
$certificate->getDomain(); // returns "spatie.be"
```

### Getting the certificate's signing algorithm

Returns the algorithm used for signing the certificate

```php
$certificate->getSignatureAlgorithm(); // returns "RSA-SHA256"
```

### Getting the certificate's organization

Returns the organization belonging to the certificate

```php
$certificate->getOrganization(); // returns "Spatie BVBA"
```

### Getting the additional domain names

A certificate can cover multiple (sub)domains. Here's how to get them.

```php
$certificate->getAdditionalDomains(); // returns ["spatie.be", "www.spatie.be]
```

A domain name return with this method can start with `*` meaning it is valid for all subdomains of that domain.

### Getting the fingerprint

```php
$certificate->getFingerprint(); // returns a fingerprint for the certificate
```

### Getting the SHA256 fingerprint

```php
$certificate->getFingerprintSha256(); // returns a SHA256 fingerprint for the certificate
```

### Getting the date when the certificate becomes valid

```php
$certificate->validFromDate(); // returns an instance of Carbon
```

### Getting the expiration date

```php
$certificate->expirationDate(); // returns an instance of Carbon
```

### Determining if the certificate is still valid

Returns true if the current Date and time is between `validFromDate` and `expirationDate`.

```php
$certificate->isValid(); // returns a boolean
```

You also use this method to determine if a given domain is covered by the certificate. Of course it'll keep checking if the current Date and time is between `validFromDate` and `expirationDate`.

```php
$certificate->isValid('spatie.be'); // returns true;
$certificate->isValid('laravel.com'); // returns false;
```

### Determining if the certificate is still valid until a given date

Returns true if the certificate is valid and if the `expirationDate` is after the given date.

```php
$certificate->isValidUntil(Carbon::now()->addDays(7)); // returns a boolean
```

### Determining if the certificate is expired

```php
$certificate->isExpired(); // returns a boolean if expired
```

### Convert the certificate to an array

You can convert a certificate to an array using the `toArray` method.

```php
$certificateProperties = $certificate->toArray();
```

The properties can be used to create a new instance of the certificate.

```php
\Spatie\SslCertificate\SslCertificate::createFromArray($certificateProperties);
```

## Testing

```bash
composer test
```
